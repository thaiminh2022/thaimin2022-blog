## Some notes before reading

When i first made this blog, my initial thought was it just need to be simple, a place to display some texts and images. However, it had a lot of problems with the colors and how the data displayed. They may not look easy to the eyes to some users.

Im a Vietnamese and the GCSE exam is coming near (2 more days from this post) so this update gonna have 2 different parts.

## MY problems with the blog

- Weird ass random theme i found on google
![Tailwind theme](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/drive-viewer/AKGpihaA34JAHrjMDkpvH4hhHWKXwdu9kbnTtaVyfh925Ir4R5os_8XSGkpIefItVa4VHVsUZ39XpiGUJtZm7rNgSUo0cYuQLMAY9XE=s2560)
Colorscheme was:
    - 'text': '#f9f9fb',
    - 'background': '#16161d',
    - 'primary': '#c8c7b7',
    - 'secondary': '#181920',
    - 'accent': '#929272',
    - 'accent-light': '#777d73',

- Random ass scroll to top

- Too much eye candy in blog view and no clear seperation

## Solving the problem

### Colorscheme (keypoint)
For colorscheme I decided to use ros√© pine, I first saw this theme in a video by The Primagen. Checkout [0 to LSP: Neovim RC From Scratch](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=rt0Y1oSCiolyizfX). 

<br/>

From that point almost every game uis / apps i built used that theme, it looks clean, beautiful and very coherence between colors. I can randomly throw in some color and it will still be interesting to look at (of course using basic color knowledges)

### Other changes

#### Commit 

- Remove scroll to top (we have mouse now)
- Clear seperation between header - table of content - blog
- More color to make blog more vibrant

#### Changes that i want in the future

- Change table of content position
